# Obsidian Plugins

A monorepo for managing and developing my Obsidian plugins.

## Structure

Each plugin lives in its own subdirectory:

```
obsidian-plugins/
  plugin-name/
    main.ts
    manifest.json
    styles.css
    ...
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm or pnpm

### Getting Started

```bash
# Navigate to a plugin directory
cd plugin-name

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the plugin
npm run build

# Watch for changes during development
npm run dev
```

## Plugins

| Plugin | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| [workspace-switcher](./workspace-switcher/) | Switch between a TODO workspace (3 tracks + daily note) and a focus workspace (single panel) | v1.0.0 |
